In consideration for allowing the Participant to participate in the Event, on behalf of the Participant, myself, the Participant’s parent(s) or guardian(s), heir(s), estate, insurers, assigns and anyone else who may make any claim for or on behalf of the Participant, I hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:</div>

<ol>
<li>represent  and  warrant  that  the  Participant  is  in  good  health  and  physical  condition  and  can participate in the Event, and acknowledge and understand that participation in and attendance at the Event involves certain risks and dangers of accidents, serious personal and bodily injury, including death, and property loss or damage either specifically as a result of participation in the Event or generally  in  connection  with  the  Participant’s  attendance  thereat  and any  transportation connected thereto.  I understand, have considered and evaluated the nature, scope, and extent of the risks involved, and I, for myself and on behalf of the Participant, voluntarily and freely choose to assume these risks;</li>

<li>fully and forever release, discharge and indemnify His Highness Prince Aga Khan Shia Imami Ismaili Council  for  Canada,  Council  for  Ontario and  all  other  local  Councils,  boards and  portfolios, volunteers,  employees,  contractors,  representatives,  committees,  associations,  appointed  officials, successors, sponsors of the Event, together with all Event directors, volunteers, teachers, staff, coaches, training and medical personnel (collectively, the “Released Parties”) of and from any and all causes  of  action,  lawsuits,  losses,  damages,  injuries  howsoever  occurring,  whether  by  negligence  or otherwise  (including  death),  claims,  demands,  sums,  costs,  expenses  (including  legal  fees  and disbursements), and any other liability of any kind, of or to me or the Participant or any other person, directly  or  indirectly  arising  out  of  or  in  connection  with  the  Event,  including,  without  limitation, participation  of  the  Participant  in  the  Event,  including,  without  limitation,  transportation connected to the Event;</li>

<li>agree not to initiate any lawsuit, court action or other legal proceeding against the Released Parties, nor  join  or  assist  in  the  prosecution  of  any  claim  for  money  damages,  which  anyone  may  have,  on account  of  loss,  damage  or  injury  sustained  by  me,  the  Participant  or  others  howsoever  occurring, whether by negligence or otherwise in connection with the selection, attendance and participation of  the Participant in the Event or transportation connected thereto and I waive any right to do so. This means that I cannot sue or hold the Released Parties responsible for any loss, damage, or injury that I or the Participant may experience related to the Event including, without limitation, transportation connected to the Event;</li>

<li>agree to indemnify and reimburse the Released Parties from and for any sums, costs, or expenses (including legal fees and disbursements) incurred or suffered by any of the Released Parties or  paid  by  them  to  any  person  (including  me  or  my  insurers)  in  connection  with  any  accident,  loss, damage, injuries, howsoever occurring, whether by negligence or otherwise (including death), claims, demands, lawsuits, expenses and any other liability of any kind, sustained by me or others in connection with the Participant’s participation in the Event or transportation connected thereto. This means that I will reimburse the Released Parties if anyone makes a claim against them based on damages or injuries the Participant suffers or caused;</li>

<li>waive any insurers’ right to make a claim against the Released Parties based on insurance payments made to me or on my behalf, or to the Participant, for any reason. This means any of my insurers, or insurers of the Participant, have no right of subrogation; </li>

<li>understand that the Released Parties do not provide any insurance, either life, medical or liability, for any illness, accident, injury, loss, or damage that may arise in connection with Participant’s participation in and attendance at the Event and any transportation connected thereto. If I want insurance of any kind on behalf of the Participant, I must obtain my own.  I  will  pay  all medical  emergency  expenses  and  all  subsequent  medical expenses in the event of any illness, accident, or injury incurred by me or the Participant in connection with the Event; </li>

<li>acknowledge that if any portion of this Acknowledgement, Release and Waiver is held to be invalid or unenforceable,  all  other  provisions  shall  nevertheless  continue  to  be  valid  and  enforceable.  This Acknowledgement, Release and Waiver supersedes any oral or written statements made by or to me or the Participant in connection with the Event and transportation connected thereto. I understand that I cannot terminate, cancel or revoke this Acknowledgement, Release and Waiver for any reason; </li>

<li>agree that, in the event that I cannot be reached in a medical emergency, I hereby authorize and
permit  the  Released  Parties  and  event  personnel  to  administer  first  aid  to  the  Participant,  and  to authorize  such  other  medical  treatment  and  transportation  as  may  be  recommended  by  physicians, paramedics,  and  other  medical  personnel,  in  the  event  of  any  illness,  accident  or  injury  to  the Participant; </li>

<li>give and grant perpetually to His Highness Prince Aga Khan Shia Imami Ismaili Council for Canada, Council for Ontario and all other local Councils, boards and portfolios volunteers, exclusively, the irrevocable right (including, without limitation, all now and hereafter existing common law, statutory and moral rights throughout the world and regardless of whether or not such rights are now known) to use  the Participant’s  name, photograph,  image  and  likeness,  and  voice  (the  “Attributes”)  in  any  and  all publicity  purposes,  commercial  or  otherwise,  in  any  and  all  media  without  compensation  or  further notification including, without limitation, the perpetual and unlimited right to reproduce (by electrical transcription,  tape  or  other  recording  process  whether  now  known  or  hereafter  developed)  any materials produced incorporating the Attributes, and the complete and unencumbered right throughout the world, to exhibit, record, reproduce, broadcast, transmit, publish, sell, distribute, perform and use for any purpose, in any manner, by any means and in any medium, whether now known or hereafter developed, all or any part or parts of the matter and things referred to in this paragraph.
